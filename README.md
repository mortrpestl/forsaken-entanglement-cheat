# Dialog Box Detection to Counter Forsaken 1x1x1x1 'Entanglement' Attack

This program was developed as a precursor to a macro dedicated for automatically clicking the windows that appear when attacked by the boss 1x1x1x1 in the Roblox Game Forsaken.

However, this program if improved is not limited to the game. It can be used to detect window dialog boxes, particularly pop-ups and can help mitigate viruses that utilize pop-ups.

Recommendations:
- increase and uniformize data points in the dataset (increase to at least 100), and also use Windows dialog boxes to further generalize
- use a more recent version of You Only Look Once (YOLO)

Software and Paradigms Used:
